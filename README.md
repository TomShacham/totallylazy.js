[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/danielbodart/totallylazy-js/branches/master/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/danielbodart/totallylazy-js)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40bodar%2Ftotallylazy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40bodar%2Ftotallylazy)

LOTS STILL MISSING!

 * Written in Typescript
 * Targeting ESNext (if using JS you will need babel etc)
 * Transducers for both sync and async code
 * Extensive use of Promise, Iterators, Generators and AsyncIterators
 * Includes HTTP as a function (think minimal UtterlyIdle/HTTP4K)
 * Minimal dependencies (just polyfills if needed)
 
 TODO
 * NPM Publishing directory ('remove src')
 * LINQ/SQL projections using the Transducers (think LazyRecords)
