# TotallyLazy.js

LOTS STILL MISSING!

 * Written in Typescript
 * Targeting ESNext (if using JS you will need babel etc)
 * Transducers for both sync and async code
 * Extensive use of Promise, Iterators, Generators and AsyncIterators
 * Includes HTTP as a function (think minimal UtterlyIdle/HTTP4K)
 * Minimal dependencies (just polyfills if needed)
 
 Coming soon
 * LINQ/SQL projections using the Transducers (think LazyRecords)
